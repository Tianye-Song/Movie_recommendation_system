# Movie Recommendation System
## Introduction
In this project, the groups will implement, evaluate, operate, monitor, and evolve a recommendation service for a scenario of a movie streaming service. The group will work with a scenario of a streaming service with about 1 million customers and 27,000 movies (for comparison, Netflix has about 180 million subscribers and over 300 million estimated users worldwide and about 13,000 titles worldwide). Consider the group is in the early days of video streaming and are building a Netflix-like streaming business with a massive catalog of not very recent movies that you could license cheaply.

The focus of this assignment is to operate a recommendation service in production, which entails many concerns, including deployment, scaling, reliability, drift and feedback loops.
